## How to contribute

### Raising issues

If you found a bug or you'd like a new feature or change, you
can [raise it as an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/gchq/sleeper/issues/new). Please fill in all relevant
information.

Before making a new one, please search the existing issues to check if your change has already been requested.
Comment on an issue to let us know you're interested.

### Contributing code

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Read the [developer guide](docs/09-dev-guide.md) for
help setting up a development environment.

You can contribute code for any issue by raising a pull request from your own fork of the repository. Raise an issue
for your change if there isn't one already.

#### How to sign the CLA

When you raise a pull request for the first time, a bot will comment asking you to sign the Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). Click the link in the comment to read and sign it. The pull request will update once you've signed.

#### GitHub Actions on a fork

When you push code to your fork, GitHub Actions workflows will run automatically to validate your change. Please check
these are successful in the Actions tab of your fork. You can still raise a pull request for help to get it working.

These workflows involve publishing test and linting results as separate checks. GitHub Actions requires separate
permissions in your fork to do this, which you can set in the repository settings under
Actions > General > Workflow permissions > Select "Read and write permissions".

### Getting help

Read our [common problems and their solutions](docs/11-common-problems-and-their-solutions.md) to see if your problem
is covered there.

For help with an issue you can post in the issue's comments.

You can also [raise any question as a GitHub issue](https://github.com/gchq/sleeper/issues/new), and we'll get back to
you with a response. Please note this will be public on GitHub.
