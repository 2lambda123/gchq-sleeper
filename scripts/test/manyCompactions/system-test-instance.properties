# The ingest mode to write random data. This should be either 'direct', 'queue', 'batcher', or 'generate_only'.
# Direct means that the data is written directly using an ingest coordinator.
# Queue means that the data is written to a Parquet file and an ingest job is created. This is posted to the queue
# configured by the property `sleeper.systemtest.ingest.queue`.
# Batcher means that the data is written to a Parquet file and posted to the ingest batcher. This will be processed
# based on the table properties under `sleeper.table.ingest.batcher`. These are defaulted based on instance properties
# under `sleeper.default.ingest.batcher`.
# Generate only means that the data is written to a Parquet file in the system test bucket, but the file is not
# ingested. The ingest will need to be performed manually in a separate step.
